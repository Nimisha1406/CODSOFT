This repository contains the Machine Learning projects completed as part of my CodSoft Internship.
The projects focus on real-world classification problems using Python and Scikit-learn.

📌 Projects Included

1. Movie Genre Classification
A text classification system that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot description using NLP techniques and TF-IDF vectorization.
Tech Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
A classification model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression and feature scaling.
Tech Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, StandardScaler, Logistic Regression

3. Spam SMS Detection
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) based model that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Ham using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.
Tech Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF
